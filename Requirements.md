**Functional Requirements**

**User Customization**

1. **Character Selection**:  
    Each user must log into the platform and select their desired character from the available ones in the simulated city.
2. **Modification of Urban Elements**:  
    Users should be able to add urban elements such as buildings, parks, rivers, public spaces (e.g., markets).

**Interactions**

1. **Chat Interface**:
    - A chat window will be available for the active user.
    - Conversations with AI-driven characters will be displayed in this chat window.
    - Users can interact directly with the AI characters through chat.
2. **Chat History**:
    - All chat conversations should include a history that can be stored and revisited.
3. **Character Participation in Events**:
    - Each character should be able to participate in various events and collaborate with other characters.
4. **Natural Language Conversations**:
    - Use GPT-4 and Llama 3 language models to facilitate natural, human-like conversations between characters.

**Software Environment**

- The city environment should be implemented with simple elements initially, with potential for updates and improvements in future versions.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Browser Compatibility**:
    - The platform must be compatible with the Chrome browser.
2. **Performance**:
    - Maintain acceptable speed and minimal hardware resource usage.
3. **Response Time**:
    - Ensure quick response times for each character during conversations.
4. **Extensibility**:
    - The system should support adding new features without disrupting core functionalities, allowing for easy updates.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - A simple, intuitive, and minimalistic UI design should be implemented to enhance user experience.

**Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to provide users with insights into the general thought patterns and behaviors of a real-world cityâ€™s residents by observing and interacting with AI-driven characters within a simulated community.
